Your Love
The Outfield

Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older

I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover

I just wanna use your love tonight, oh
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shaking
But something in my mind's not making sense
It's been a while since we've been all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feeling

As you're leaving, please, would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon

I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah
I don't wanna lose your love tonight, yeah

I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I just wanna use your love tonight
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

(Use your love, lose your love)
Your love (use your love)
Well, I don't wanna lose (lose your—, tonight)
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna lose (use your—, tonight)
Your love (lose your—, tonight)
Your love, your love (use your—, tonight)
Your love (I don't wanna lose your love tonight)
(Use your—, tonight)
